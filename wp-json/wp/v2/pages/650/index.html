We want everyone to have fun, in a safe and welcoming environment at all of our events. Everyone attending, including special guests and volunteers, is required to agree with the following code of conduct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pinball machines in use have been provided by private collectors from all over the state and must always be treated with respect and care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All players are expected to conduct themselves in a courteous manner and to contribute to a safe and welcoming play environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TAZPIN officials noticing visitors with excessively aggressive playing or abusive handling of a machine will be asked to leave the event with no refund. (Abusive handling such as punching, kicking, lifting, tipping, or rocking a machine, or hitting the glass in any way).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not place food or beverages on the playfield glass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents must supervise their kids at all times. Encourage the excitement you see in younger generations; they are the next game coders, designers, artists, and entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please report any problems you find by advising a TAZPIN team member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start a game, please finish your game. After finishing each game, look around to see if others are waiting to play it. If so, please allow the next person(s) to play. If you want to play more, please go to the back of the line and wait your turn again or play another machine for a little while. Playing a multi-player game is a good way to socialize with others!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TAZPIN is a family friendly event and excessive use of foul language or aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"covid19-policy\">COVID-19 policy<\/h2>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-edited-300x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-689\" style=\"width:172px\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-edited-300x300-1.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-edited-300x300-1-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/image-edited-300x300-1-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>TazPin is committed to taking all reasonable steps to provide the safest possible environment.
